INTRODUCTION: 

This is meant to just be a side project to take a break from more "serious" things I'm learning/working on at the time. I used to play "roguelike" games a lot so I thought that I might as well try and make my own. I always found game development to be a sort of interesting way of implementing programming concepts so I wanted to sort of explore it by... well... making a game! Below is the general brainstorming for the game. It'll probably look like a bunch of jargon but it's just what I type out while I'm thinking of ideas for it. 

If you want to get involved in this for whatever reason... email me at tcs140230@utdallas.edu
