CHAPTER SUMMARY (From Book): 

In this chapter, I gave you an overview of the key C# language features that an effective MVC programmer needs to
know. These features are combined in LINQ, which I use to query data throughout this book. As I said, I am a big fan
of LINQ, and it plays an important role in MVC applications. I also showed you the async and await keywords, which
make it easier to work with asynchronous methods—this is a topic that I return to in Chapter 19 when I show you an
advanced technique for integrating asynchronous programming into your MVC controllers.
In the next chapter, I turn my attention to the Razor View Engine, which is the mechanism by which dynamic data
is inserted into views.
