Straight from book: 

In this chapter, I explained the context in which the MVC Framework exists and how it compares to Web Forms.
I described the benefits of using the MVC framework, the structure of this book and the software that you will require
to follow the examples.

You saw how the ASP.NET MVC platform addresses the weaknesses of ASP.NET Web Forms, and how its modern
design delivers advantages to developers who want to write high-quality, maintainable code. In the next chapter,
you’ll see the MVC Framework in action in a simple demonstration of the features that deliver these benefits.
