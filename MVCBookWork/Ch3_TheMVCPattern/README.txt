Chapter Summary from Book:

In this chapter, I introduced you to the MVC architectural pattern and compared it to some other patterns you
may have seen or heard of before. I discussed the significance of the domain model and introduced dependency
injection, which allows us to decouple components to enforce a strict separation between the parts of an application.
I demonstrated a simple unit test and you saw how decoupled components and dependency injection make unit
testing simple and easy. In the next chapter, I describe the essential C# language features that are used in MVC
Framework applications.


Main Takeaway: 

Wordpad doesn't have an auto-restore/recovery feature like Microsoft Word... so many notes... gone...
