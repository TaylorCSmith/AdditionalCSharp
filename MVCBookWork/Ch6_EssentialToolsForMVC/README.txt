Chapter Summary (from book):

In this chapter, I looked at the three tools I find essential for effective MVC development: Ninject, the built-in Visual Studio support for unit testing, and Moq. There are many alternatives, both open source and commercial, for all three tools and you will not lack alternatives if you do not get along with the tools I like and use. You may find that you do not like TDD or unit testing in general, or that you are happy performing DI and mocking manually. That, of course, is entirely your choice. However, I think there are some substantial benefits in using all  three tools in the development cycle. If you are hesitant to adopt them because you have never tried them, I encourage  you to suspend disbelief and give them a go, at least for the duration of this book.
